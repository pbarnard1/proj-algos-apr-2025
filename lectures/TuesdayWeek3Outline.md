# Week 3 Tuesday in Projects & Algorithms - April 29, 2025

## Announcements:
- Don't forget about this week's discussion topics and core assignments!!!  We have three core assignments this week:
    - Group Project Proposal
    - Fronts in Singly Linked Lists
    - Display in Singly Linked Lists
- Don't forget to submit your Group Project Proposal to the platform if it's already approved!  If your group hasn't contacted me with a proposal yet, please do so today!!
- To pass the course:
    - At least 5 out of 8 discussion topics
    - At least 7 out of 8 core assignments - the needed 7 MUST include ALL 4 project assignments related to your solo and group projects!
    - Working solo project (Weeks 1-2)
    - Working group project (Weeks 3-4)

## Solo project presentations:
Format:
- Tell us what your project is all about and what stack(s) you used and why you built this particular application.
- Showcase all the MVP (minimum viable product) features, such as full CRUD in a non-User model.
- Explain some of your biggest challenges and triumphs (optional).

Presentations will be roughly 5-7 minutes each.

Notes:
- You will likely be in awe of what others made!  But that also means...
- ...you might feel a bit of imposter syndrome.  For example, you might wonder "Why didn't I think of that?" or "How did they pull off this feature that I wanted that I couldn't figure out?"  Remember: *don't compare yourself to others in terms of skills!*  It's all about your own *personal growth*!
